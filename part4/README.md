# Part 4: Diffusion and the random walk

This part will introduce us to diffusion using a simple random walk simulation.

This notebook also uses `custom.mplstyle`. (You can download it from [Part 2](https://github.com/StatPhysBio/biophysics/tree/main/part2) and see tips in [Part 3](https://github.com/StatPhysBio/biophysics/tree/main/part3#part-3-statistical-distributions-statistics-and-the-central-limit-theorem) on how to have it used by this notebook.)

## Texts on stochastic processes

The study of stochastic processes is an incredibly rich subject. The following are some useful texts ranging from the undergraduate to advanced graduate levels.

- *An Introduction to Stochastic Processes in Physics*, Lemons
	- An introduction target toward undergraduate students and features diffusion and Langevin equations
- *Stochastic Processes for Physicists*, Jacobs
	- An introduction for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students and includes stochastic calculus and Fokker-Planck equations
- *Stochastic methods (4th edition)*, Gardiner
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry (3rd edition)*, van Kampen
