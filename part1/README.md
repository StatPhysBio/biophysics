# Part 1: Python tutorial

The best way to learn programming is by doing. 
Here, we begin to learn what tools are at our disposal and how to use them.

## Python basics

There are many tutorials for learning Python.
A quick Google search will show you Python documentation, open courses, YouTube videos, Stack Overflow threads, etc.
If you have any questions, know that there is most likely a solution or answer on the web somewhere.
(See [Guideline 3](https://github.com/StatPhysBio/biophysics/tree/main/part0#guidelines).)
While what you can do with Python is practically limitless and so is the amount of information on the web about Python, we will learn specifically about Python in the context of scientific computing.
What you learn here is not by any means exhaustive, but it should be enough to do some interesting things in biophysics.

A nice tutorial that's easy to follow and is thorough enough for our purposes is [Introduction to Programming in the Biological Sciences Bootcamp](https://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2021/index.html) by Justin Bois.
We will attempt to go over as much of the relevant basics as we can in class.
**I expect you to go through lessons 3 through 10 if you do not have any prior Python experience.**

## Numpy and plotting tutorials

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a package which lays the foundation for performing scientific computing using Python.
Numpy is developing their own [tutorials](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/index.html).
Tutorials on Numpy basics can be found elsewhere ubiquitously. 
For instance, [Machine Learning with Python](https://machine-learning-with-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) by Tirthajyoti Sarkar provides a nice [notebook](https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Machine-Learning-with-Python#essential-tutorial-type-notebooks-on-pandas-and-numpy) for getting a handle on the basics and conventions of Numpy.

There are many plotting packages for Python.
We will largely be using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
(Other good packages include [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), and [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).)
Matplotlib provides a nice [page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index) which points you to many tutorials.
Again, the best way to learn is by doing.
To become familiar with how to plot using Matplotlib (or other packages), devise a question (story), produce or obtain some numbers, and ask yourself how can you answer that question (tell that story).

There are many ways to tell stories through data visualization.
Producing the optimal visual isn't necessarily an easy problem.
It's easy to make a visual for the story you *think* you're telling, but that visual may not actually communicate the story you'd like it to tell.
Additionally, even if you do choose the optimal type of plot for your story, it's easy to create an ugly plot that no one will want to look at.
Below are some useful texts on how you can tell stories through data visualization and on making good choices when plotting.

## Texts on visualization

- *Envisioning Information*, Tufte
- *Fundamentals of Data Visualization*, Wilke
- *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, Tufte
