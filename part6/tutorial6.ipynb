    "The Moran model is used to evolve a fixed population of $N$ individuals forward in time and study population genetics phenomena. In contrast to other population genetics models, changes in the population occur asynchronously and are modeled in an individual-based fashion in the Moran framework. I.e., only one individual changes at a point in time as opposed to the *entire* population undergoing mutation, reproduction, etc. events in a single generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Moran model can consider many genotypes in a population, but, for simplicity, we consider only two here: $a$ and $b$. $a$ and $b$ could represent two subpopulations such as [healthy and cancerous cells](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-005-9046-8) or [variants of virus, perhaps those susceptible to a treatment and those that aren't](https://elifesciences.org/articles/76004). On the other hand, we could also think of $a$ and $b$ merely as two populations with no significant implications. It all depends on our modeling goals and the parameters we employ when running the simulation."

    "# Moran neutral model\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest version of the Moran model seeks to describe neutral evolution, which means that neither $a$ nor $b$ individuals have any fitness advantage over the other. In this case, the model is characterized by the following. Let $x$ be the amount of individuals in the population that have genotype $a$. Due to the constraint on the population size, $n_a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., N\\}$. The reaction equations for $n_a$ are\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "\\text{reaction, }r_i& \\text{rate, } k_i \\\\\n",
    "n_a \\rightarrow n_a+1,\\;\\;\\;\\; & b_a = (N-n_a) \\frac{n_a}{N} \\\\[0.3em]\n",
    "n_a \\rightarrow n_a-1, \\;\\;\\;\\; & d_a = n_a \\frac{N-n_a}{N} \\\\[0.3em]\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_a$ is the birth rate and $d_a$ is the death rate. For $n_a$ to increase by 1, an individual with genotype $b$ must die, and an individual with genotype $a$ must give birth. $b$ individuals die at rate $N - n_a$, and the probability that the new parent is an $a$ is $n_a / N$. Parallel reasoning follows for the definition of $d_a$. Observe that $b_a = d_a$ in the case of neutral evolution. Also note that each event that occurs over the run of the simulation is a combination of a death event and a birth event: this maintains the constant size of the population. In this particular configuration of the Moran model, any individual can die, and any individual can be the parent of the offspring that replaces the dead individual, including the one that has died. (In contrast, other configurations might put spatial constraints on which individuals can be the parent of the offspring.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental questions that can be investigated with the Moran model is what is the probability that one of these subpopulations takes over the entire population and how long until that happens? A takeover event is referred to as fixation in population genetics literature; in mathematics, the state at which a takeover happens is called an absorbing state (once the state is entered, it cannot be left). Concretely, if the population originally was diverse and then $a$ became the only type of individual that exists in the population, $a$ has fixed. We will use this fixation condition to determine how long the simulation will be run since no dynamics occur after fixation in the neutral Moran model."

    "We now add selection and mutation into the Moran model. Evolutionary fitness can be interpreted as a genotype's (here, $a$ or $b$) ability to produce offspring in the next generation compared to other individuals. I.e., fitness is rate at which different types of individuals reproduce. Crucially, a genotype's fitness depends on the environment in which it exists. Selection is the process by which the population is shaped over time by these fitness differences and is the most responsible for a population's adaptation to the evironment. Mutations are errors made in an genotype during replication or reproduction. While this may not change the composition of the population as strongly as selection, mutations can introduce novel genotypes into a population. \n",

In this way, fitness is the probability that an offspring from that individual is successful. Additionally, let $\\mu$ be the rate at which one individual changes to another. Here, the mutation rate is the same irrespective of an individual's type; however, more complicated models could have individual-specific mutation rates $\\mu_{a \\to b}$, $\\mu_{b \\to a}$, etc.\n",

    "## Substitution events\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N \\mu \\ll 1$ and $s \\ll 1$, an interesting phenomenon can occur. In this regime, the absorbing states ($n_a = 0$ or $n_a = N$) can be reached and are unstable because of the nonzero mutation rates. Even with small values of $\\pi_{a \\to b}$, $\\pi_{b \\to a}$, the entire population can transition from being fixed at $a$ to being fixed at $b$ or vice versa. This transition is called a substitution. The rate at which substitutions occur during neutral evolution and with selection can be computed. (For further reading, see the section on [substitution dynamics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1471-2105-8-S6-S7.pdf#page=13) in LÃ¤ssig's overview.) To get a better intuition for the substitution rate, the mutation rate is equal to the substitution rate for neutral evolution."
