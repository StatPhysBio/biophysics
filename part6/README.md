# Part 6: Population dynamics with the Moran model

This part introduces us to the Moran model, a forward-in-time population dynamics model, implemented using the Gillespie algorithm.
We will study neutral evolution as well as evolution that incorporates selection and mutation processes.
Besides looking at realizations of these processes, we will compute easily interpretable statistics to understand the different regimes of evolution.
