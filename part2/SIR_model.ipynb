    "[SIR models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_without_vital_dynamics) describe the spread of a pathogen in a population. The SIR model breaks down the overall population into three subsets: \n",
    "* the susceptible population $S$, which consists of folks who haven't been infected yet and can be infected\n",
    "* the infected population $I$, which can recover from the infection or infect the susceptible population\n",
    "* the recovered population $R$, which assumedly can't be reinfected. Note that sometimes this group is referred to as \"removed,\" which could also include death by infection.\n",

Because of this relationship, we consider the equation for $dR(t)/dt$ to be superfluous, as at each time point: $R(t) = 1- S(t) -I(t)$.
