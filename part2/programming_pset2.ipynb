    "[SIR models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_without_vital_dynamics) describe the spread of a pathogen in a population. The SIR model breaks down the overall population into three subsets: \n",
    "* the susceptible population $S$, which consists of folks who haven't been infected yet and can be infected\n",
    "* the infected population $I$, which can recover from the infection or infect the susceptible population\n",
    "* the recovered population $R$, which assumedly can't be reinfected. Note that sometimes this group is referred to as \"removed,\" which could also include death by infection.\n",

Here, we are letting $S$, $I$, and $R$ be the **fractions of the population** which are susceptible, infectious, or recovered, respectively: $S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1$. Because of this relationship, we consider the equation for $dR(t)/dt$ to be superfluous, as at each time point $R(t) = 1- S(t) -I(t)$. Additionally, by modeling the fractions of the overall population, we don't need to worry about what the size of the total population, making our lives a bit easier. "
