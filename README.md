# Biophysics programming component

This is the homepage for the programming section of the Biophysics course.
You will find instructions, readings, and Jupyter notebooks which will introduce you to programming, statistics, simulations, and inference.
It is our aim that what you learn in this component will parallel and enrich what you learn in other components of the class.
We will focus on different ideas and concepts, denoted as "Parts," for given sets of weeks during the quarter.
Each "Part" has a corresponding folder containing tutorials along with detailed instructions and assignments.
If you have any difficulty accessing the resources or find the instructions to be misleading or incomprehensible, please go to the Slack page for help.

Notably, this page is subject to change and will be updated periodically as the instructors see fit.
